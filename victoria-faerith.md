## Features

### Darkvision ( Tiefling )

You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

### Fiendish Legacy ( Tiefling )

You are the recipient of a fiendish legacy that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose a legacy from the Fiendish Legacies table: 

Abyssal, associated with Chaotic Evil planes;
Chthonic, associated with Neutral Evil planes;
Infernal, associated with Lawful Evil planes. 

You gain the 1st-level benefit of the chosen legacy.

Starting at 3rd level and again at 5th level, you gain the ability to cast a higher-level Spell with this trait, as shown on the table. Once you cast the Spell with this trait, you can’t cast that Spell with it again until you finish a Long Rest*; however, you can cast the Spell using any Spell Slots you have of the appropriate level.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the Spells you cast with
this trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage).

| Legacy | 1st Level | 3rd Level | 5th Level |
| ------ | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Abyssal | You have Resistance to Poison Damage. You also know the Poison Spray cantrip. | Ray of Sickness | Hold Person |
| Chthonic | You have Resistance to Necrotic Damage. You also know the Chill Touch cantrip. | False Life | Ray of Enfeeblement |
| Infernal | You have Resistance to Fire Damage. You also know the Fire Bolt cantrip. | Hellish Rebuke | Darkness |

### Otherworldly Presence ( Tiefling )

You know the Thaumaturgy cantrip. When you cast it with this trait, the Spell uses the same spellcasting ability you use for your Fiendish Legacy trait.

### Instrumental Training ( Background )
You gain Tool Proficiency* with three Musical Instruments* of your choice.

### Inspiring Song ( Background )

As you finish a Short Rest or a Long Rest, you can play a song on a Musical Instrument with which you have Tool Proficiency and give Inspiration* to allies who hear the song. The number of allies you can affect in this way equals your Proficiency Bonus.

### Spellcasting ( Wizard )

Each time you gain a Wizard level, you can add two Wizard Spells of your choice to your Spellbook for free. Each of these Spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your Adventures, you might find other Spells that you can add to your Spellbook (see “Your Spellbook”).

You can cast a Wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your Spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

### Arcane Recovery ( Wizard )

You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

### Arcane Tradition ( Wizard )

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Training in War and Song

When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor, and you gain proficiency with one type of one-handed melee weapon of your choice.

You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don’t already have it.

### Bladesong

Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke an elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren’t wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.

You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).

While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:

- You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1)
- Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
- You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.

You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

## Biography

### Personality Traits

- I refuse to go by the name V. This is what my partner called me. I lash out at any and all that use that name.
- Years on investigations and on the streets left me with a habit of shielding my emotions at face value. I still express myself with music and the occasional slip.

### Bonds

- Ken was my partner, my "real" father. He is now dead and I feel lost without him. Someone killed my mentor. I will kill them in return and restore honor Ken's name.
- My parents never believed in me. I will prove them wrong and be better than them.

### Ideals

- Greater Good. Our lot is to lay down our lives in defense of others.

### Flaws

- My hatred of my enemies is blind and unreasoning.
- I am suspicious of strangers and suspect the worst of them. Most people are good, but it takes one bad person to fuck you.

### Backstory

Victoria got her start on the city streets, spending her teen years selling papers and acting as a courier. Through this line of work, she developed a close relationship with a local detective by the name of Ken, who took her under his wing. In exchange for information on her various odd jobs, Ken would teach her the harmonica, swordsmanship, and mentor her in the ways of detective work. She would later join onto his practice as his partner in her early twenties.

Victoria and Ken worked many jobs together, at the disapproval of her parents, who regarded law enforcement with disrespect. Victoria excelled at investigation however, wanting to push her limits beyond a meager existence on the streets and excel on her own. Ken declined to involve her in one job however, claiming the work was too dangerous. Out of respect for her mentor, Victoria held off as long as she could as the weeks went by. By the time she involved herself, it was too late. She discovered her partner's decimated corpse in an alley, with no sign or evidence of the attackers. Their practice was burned to the ground in her brief absence.

Victoria blames herself. Taking up her partner's broken sword, she has claimed vengeance on those that slew Ken. After years of no leads, she now wanders, returning to the odd jobs of her teen years, playing the harmonica, and keeping an ear to the ground for more information on her partner's murder.

While Ken's command over his blade song was controlled and serene, Victoria's is violent, uncontrollable, and forceful. Her control over her power is distracted and unrefined...for now.
